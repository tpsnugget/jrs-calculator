   - Work on adding an integer to another single integer and display that
      in the scratchpad. DONE.

# Version 5:
   Add in CE functionality. DONE.
   Add in -, *, and /. DONE.
   Negative and decimal answers work too even though I have not added in the functionality
      for the user to choose those options from the keyboard.

   - Add Square Root, %, inverse. DONE

# Version 7:
   Add in divide by zero error checking. DONE.

Cleanup Items:
   Limit display to a certain number of digits so they don't run out the side of
      the scratchpad
   Move display in scratchpad to the right side
